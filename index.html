                    CardsCardsCards is a cards game based on YuGiOh cards with funny pictures from Spain. The game was
                    developed in Java and it had both a Client and a Server module.

                    Keepit is a note program. It's that simple. It was developed as a final project for my development
                    degree. You can create, view and delete notes.
                    Also, you can search any note by title, category or label. It is entirely on Spanish, but it could
                    be translated easily to other language.
                    It accepted multi-user and used a MySQL database to store all notes.

                    Spanish Card Game was a project written in Python. It is based on "Mona" spanish card game and
                    recreates it automatically on a window. It accepts up to 10 players.
                    It is based on a card library and modified to accept the Pygame library to make it look a little
                    more nice and have a GUI support. The game can be played infinitely and always
                    wins one.

                    LifeProject was a project made in Java where I intended to make a survival and city management where
                    you had to be the "god" of a
                    civilization and make them go as big as possible. You should watch out for them, mostly food, water
                    and some basic resources like wood and stone. I planned to make it hard for them to
                    prosper and grow up, but if it happened, it would be easy to continue to late game. It would have
                    had enemies that raided your village and some random events that would have made it hard.
                    At this moment the game is paused. It made it to de "0.8-indev" version.

                    SpaceDroid was a game originally made for Android using block coding on MIT's AppInventor2 website.
                    It was ported to Java, where is it right now. The game has a "retro"-like style
                    where every texture is a 8bits 32x32px pixel-art. There are 3 main space ships for the user and it
                    featured up to 6 different enemies with different health. Also, it had a shop where
                    you can change the munition, the ship or buy some upgrades for it. It was an infinite game where the
                    difficulty maintained. The position and the enemies were selected randomly and
                    it was likely that you couldn't have two games that were similar.
