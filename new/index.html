                        Spanish Card Game was a project written in Python. It is based on "Mona" spanish card game and recreates it automatically on a window. It accepts up to 10 players.
                        It is based on a card library and modified to accept the Pygame library to make it look a little more nice and have a GUI support. The game can be played infinitely and always
                        wins one.

                        LifeProject was a project made in Java where I intended to make a survival and city management where you had to be the "god" of a
                        civilization and make them go as big as possible. You should watch out for them, mostly food, water and some basic resources like wood and stone. I planned to make it hard for them to
                        prosper and grow up, but if it happened, it would be easy to continue to late game. It would have had enemies that raided your village and some random events that would have made it hard.
                        At this moment the game is paused. It made it to de "0.8-indev" version.

                        SpaceDroid was a game originally made for Android using block coding on MIT's AppInventor2 website. It was ported to Java, where is it right now. The game has a "retro"-like style
                        where every texture is a 8bits 32x32px pixel-art. There are 3 main space ships for the user and it featured up to 6 different enemies with different health. Also, it had a shop where
                        you can change the munition, the ship or buy some upgrades for it. It was an infinite game where the difficulty maintained. The position and the enemies were selected randomly and
                        it was likely that you couldn't have two games that were similar.
